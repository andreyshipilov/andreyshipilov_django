When your press correspondent visited the Olympic park a year ago for the first time after the beginning of its layout I saw the first piles of a prospect main hockey stadium of 2014 Olympic Games. In two months when I visited this place for the second time with a group of foreign colleagues I could already clearly see its skyline. And then four months later I was standing on one of the floors of the stadium with 12 thousands seats. You may agree that the rate of the construction work is not just rapid, but super rapid, like the speed of express transport connecting coastal and mountain clusters by a new combined motor and rail road.      </p><p>I had a chance to visit the construction site of this transport artery for the third time. It was interesting to witness the progress of tunnelers at the first of six constructing tunnels in the mountain (it is more correct to say that there will be 12 tunnels because rail and motor tunnels are laid separately, plus reserve drifts —  they are also six). I would remind that on the rail part of the first of them they cut 220 meters in September, in November this figure raised to 450 meters and in the middle of the last week they have done 790 meters from the southern entrance and another 200 meters from the northern side. The total length of the closest to the Olympic Park tunnel is 2,5 kilometers, and the third one which is the steepest will be also the longest one – more than 4 kilometers. </p><p>I have mentioned only two objects from the 203 that are being constructed according to  the new program. It is interesting that only 30 of them are related to sports competitions, the rest 173 are engineering and touristic facilities and designed for development of Sochi as a mountain and climatic health resort. <br />Our way was going to the mountains to one of the main Olympic objects the first order of which will be launched already in November 2010. The first official test competitions will be held here in February 2011. </p><p>That is ski resort “Rosa Khutor”, where sportsmen will compete in Alpine disciplines, snowboarding and freestyle. A mountain Olympic Village will be also built there. I have visited the lower base “Mzytma” for ten times within last two years and every time I witnessed significant and substantial changes that are bringing nearer the opening day of the main ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana.   </p><p>This time I have seen concrete building frames of the hotel complex on the right bank of swift-flowing Mzytma.  </p><p>— Hotel buildings will be probably the highest ones in Krasnaya Polyana, — says Alexander Belokobylsky, Executive Director of Ski resort development company Rosa  Khutor LLC Affiliate . They are built to resist 9 grades earthquake. The complex will include hotels for any categories of sports lovers. The first buildings will welcome visitors next February when Euro Cup competitions will take place here, and by the end of the next year the whole complex will be fit for accommodation. .  </p><p>— And how are things going on the mountain itself?</p><p>— At the moment FIS experts are doing pistes marking for future downhill skiing tournaments. That is the sign that the distances themselves are ready, but there is still a lot to do. The main task of our company is to complete the snow generation system: we need to run pipelines from the prepared artificial lakes up to the top base at the altitude of 2045 meters where that start point of man downhill skiing will be located.  It is one of the three constituents that are necessary for successful Olympic Games. The second task is set for the Federal Network Company that is supposed to run a power line to the mountain. Now all works are provided as before with the help of diesel generators.  The total power required for snow generating system is not less than 10MW – this will ensure pipeline pressure of 60 atm. Overall power consumption of the complex is not less than 15 MW. For comparison I would mention that the settlement of Krasnaya Polyana together with all objects consumes 6 MW. The third task – construction of a road to the finish zone and Olympic village should be solved by “Olympstroy” company – Belokobylsky determined the main directions of work until February 2011.  </p><p>I was lucky again to ascend by helicopter to the point of a prospect start of men downhill skiing and then to get first on gondolas and further on ratracs down to the intermediate and transfer stations. In some places we saw blue flags – marks of FIS experts. It means that in less than a year the piste will go exactly here.    <br />From architects to designers.</p><p>Two years ago during our first talk I asked Bernhard Russi how I may introduce him he invented position for himself – “architect of the mountain”. This time Mr.Russi introduced himself in another way: Bernhard Russi, course designer. I began our short dialogue with a question by what this metamorphose 'from architects to designers' is caused. </p><p>— It is very simple – explained Russi – Every new house is first designed by an architect and when it is built it is burnished by a designer. When I first came to Krasnaya Polyana four years ago and saw these unique Caucasus mountains, I immediately understood that we may build a beautiful ski stadium. I started its design, then improved the conceived plans and finally received the desired result. Now, when pistes already exist they need polishing up and perfection and I automatically transformed from architect to designer.  </p><p>— And what are your successes in this position?</p><p>— I would divide my job into three parts. The first is planning and designing of the prospect pistes. This goes fine and this stage is actually in the past. The second one is construction of pistes, their polishing up and marking. That is what we are doing now. The third and final stage is testing of distances by sportsmen and competitions themselves.  I am really pleased that my colleagues from FIS liked everything. They could understand my philosophy and the concept of “Rosa Khutor” employees and agree with the way we solve complicated tasks.   If not for the problems with snow in some places then with a certain tuning — adjusting of snow generating system and installation of protection fencing — competitions could be already held. </p><p>— But there is no approving document!</p><p>— Homologation of pistes is a pure formality. A supervisor of FIS relevant committee comes with inspection visit and issues the required certificate.  </p><p>— And when may this happen?</p><p>— I believe that more likely in autumn, may be in September.</p><p>— Do you expect any claims for violations of environmental norms from them or from the relevant agencies?</p><p>— What are you talking about! We tried our best to conform to the natural landscape, used as little construction equipment as possible, avoided any complicated excavation works. We also tried not to extract trees and to use clearances left after avalanche triggering. If some deforesting was necessary we prepared substantial justifications for such works.   </p><p>— What are the other acute problems?</p><p>— The most serious is training of the support staff for the whole ski resort service . This is a large and multidisciplinary facility. Neither Russia nor the Soviet Union ever welcomed mountain ski competitions of the Euro or World Cup level. Moreover we need to note that “Rosa Khutor” is a completely new ski resort. That is why the vital task for the time left before the Olympic Games is training of service and support specialists for the resort itself and competitions that will be held here.</p><p>By Leo Rossoshnik</p></div><table id="sharer"><tr><td id="sharer-text">Share:</td><td id="sharer-buttons"><table><tr><td><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-count="horizontal">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a name="fb_share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></td><td style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"><script type="text/javascript">document.write(VK.Share.button(false,{type: "round", text: "Share"}));</script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a title="Google Buzz" class="google-buzz-button" href="http://www.google.com/buzz/post" data-button-style="small-count"></a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../www.google.com/buzz/api/button.js"></script></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="banners-container"><div id="banners-wrapper"><table id="banners"><tr class="images"><td><a href="../release-103/index.html"><img src="../../../m/banners/2011-2012.png" alt="Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!" width="290" height="162" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../../project/index.html#about"><img src="../../../m/banners/vacancy.png" alt="Jobs" width="290" height="170" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots"><img src="../../../m/banners/resort_banner_1.png" alt="Rental of Сommercial Real Estate" width="290" height="159" /></a></td></tr><tr class="texts"><td><p><a href="../release-103/index.html">Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../../project/index.html#about">Jobs</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots">Rental of Сommercial Real Estate</a></p></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="bottom-container"><div id="bottom"><div id="bottom-addons"><p id="copyright" class="din-medium">&copy; 2005&mdash;2012 LLC Rosa Khutor</p><div id="search"><form action="http://www.rosakhutor.webfactional.com/en/search/" method="get" id="id_search_form"><input type="text" name="search" id="search-input" /><!--input type="submit" value="" /--></form></div><p id="sitemap" class="din-medium"><a href="../../sitemap/index.html">Sitemap</a></p></div><div id="bottom-legal"><ins class="vcard" id="bottom-contacts"><a class="url fn org" href="http://www.rosaski.com/" style="display: none;">The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company</a><p>The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company<br /><span class="adr"><span class="country-name" style="display: none;">Russia</span><span class="street-address">Business-centre "Pavlovo"</span>, <span class="locality">Village Novinki</span>, <span class="region">Istrinskiy Rayon, Moscow reg.</span>, <span class="postal-code">143581</span></span><br />
