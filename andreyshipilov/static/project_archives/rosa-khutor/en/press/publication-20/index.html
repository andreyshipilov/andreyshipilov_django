But our special correspondent found out that the next visit — an informal one, will follow already within six weeks’ time.</p><p>If Alexander Zhukov, Vice Prime Minister of the RF Government, and the Honorary President of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) Vilaly Smirnov are among the passengers of the business class of a flight to Sochi, it means that the capital city of Games-2014 is again expecting IOC’s Coordination Commission. If the traffic in Kurortny Prospekt is shut off, you do not need a fortune-teller to tell you that Vladimir Putin has arrived for the meeting with the Commission.  And if it takes you over two hours to get from Adler Airport to your Sochi hotel, you may rest assured that the road situation in the city has remained unchanged since the previous visit of the commissioners in April 2008. These are the features of the forthcoming Olympic era.</p><p>CABLE CARS “FULL STEAM AHEAD”!</p><p>For a journalist a visit to the main resort in Russia sounds intriguing. I wonder: what the receiving party will show this time in order to demonstrate the high tempo of the Olympic construction? What do they have up their sleeve, if you already were here and saw everything three months before? But, I must admit, at each new stage of history they manage to come up with a couple of new trump cards.</p><p>This time it was Sochi beltway road, close to completion. And I was not surprised when the director of FGU “Directorate for the construction and reconstruction of the Black Sea region roads” Vladimir Kuzhel announced the commissioning of the project in October, 2009. Exhausted by the traffic jams upon arrival, I did not need to be reminded of the urgency of the local traffic problems. Now it transpires that they are being solved by leaps every minute and soon will be partly solved - the new motorway will substantially relieve the load on the city center. However, such zeal is understandable — the issue of Sochi traffic is a matter of reputation for Prime Minister Putin. When he was still President, fighting for these games for our country at the historic session of IOC-2007 in Guatemala, he publicly pledged in his pristine English: “No traffic jams, I promise.”</p><p>The ex-president did not promise anything specific about the hotels. But a certain number of hotels, quality and even cost was specified in our Bid Book. Work aimed at keeping these promises is under way. Presently, it is still predominantly in the intellectual plane, though. Having arrived at the construction site of the cargo sea port in Imeretin Valley, from the conversation with its Director General Vladimir Sheyanov I unexpectedly learnt that upon discharge of its primary functions — delivery of construction materials for the Olympic projects, the port will change its intended purpose. During the Games it will become a floating hotel: the water transportation vehicles located in its insides will be used by the guests as three and four star hotels. After the end of the Olympics the port will be transformed from the cargo port into a marina. With service centers, hotels, parking lots, beach club and fuel station.</p><p>Even Rosa Khutor — the most advanced project of the present sports construction site, which works ahead of the schedule, came up with a few surprises once again. Just before our eyes, from the lower base of the skiing resort erected by Interros, the first of the 18 planned ski lifts was launched. Its length is 2,342 meters; the maximum capacity is 86 cable cars.</p><p>“So far it has been operating in a test mode — subject to stationary capacities of our diesel generator,” says Sergey Trubin, Director General of Rosa, which not only will house skiing competitions, but also freestyle with snowboard. “For regular operation the cable road needs a standby power source. The substation, which has been promised by the Federal Network Company, has not been built yet. Only by the end of 2010 they are promising to commission anther infrastructure project which is essential for us - sewerage.</p><p>What is the point of going ahead of the schedule, if the government fails to catch up with the tempo of the private investors?</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE KILLY: I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE ANIMATION AND FILMS</p><p>This time the Commission did not plan to make a tour of the projects. The twelve commissioners headed by the Chairman Jean-Claude Killy barricaded themselves inside Rodina hotel where they worked with the documents and reports of the Russian side. They were so deeply engrossed, that they saw the journalists in that very same Rodina, without leaving their workplace.</p><p>“Which faults have you detected in the work of Sochi-2014?” Where does Russia need to enhance its efforts?” I asked Mr. Killy.</p><p>“We have not detected any areas which might cause our concern”, the Frenchman slid into the same serene tone which he had used with me the year before. “We have been very pleased with the amount of work that has been done. There is still a lot to do. Therefore, the main task on the agenda for the organizers of the Game is to keep up the pace. But they are doing their best.  They are precisely where they need to be with the project. And I am confident that they will deliver the Games. If everything goes as planned, we will see remarkable Games. They will be the most compact ones in history. At least, the animation and the films that we have seen were immensely impressive.”</p><p>“Presently the preparation for the Games-2014 raises no reasons for any concern”, said the Executive Director of the Commission, Gilbert Felli. “However, in six weeks’ time we will arrive in Sochi again in order to see the construction of a number of important facilities with our own eyes, where the work, according to the promises made to us, will commence in summer.” </p><p>As they say, better safe than sorry. </p><p>Zilbert А.</p></div><table id="sharer"><tr><td id="sharer-text">Share:</td><td id="sharer-buttons"><table><tr><td><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-count="horizontal">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a name="fb_share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></td><td style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"><script type="text/javascript">document.write(VK.Share.button(false,{type: "round", text: "Share"}));</script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a title="Google Buzz" class="google-buzz-button" href="http://www.google.com/buzz/post" data-button-style="small-count"></a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../www.google.com/buzz/api/button.js"></script></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="banners-container"><div id="banners-wrapper"><table id="banners"><tr class="images"><td><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots"><img src="../../../m/banners/resort_banner_1.png" alt="Rental of Сommercial Real Estate" width="290" height="159" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../../project/index.html#about"><img src="../../../m/banners/vacancy.png" alt="Jobs" width="290" height="170" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../release-103/index.html"><img src="../../../m/banners/2011-2012.png" alt="Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!" width="290" height="162" /></a></td></tr><tr class="texts"><td><p><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots">Rental of Сommercial Real Estate</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../../project/index.html#about">Jobs</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../release-103/index.html">Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!</a></p></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="bottom-container"><div id="bottom"><div id="bottom-addons"><p id="copyright" class="din-medium">&copy; 2005&mdash;2012 LLC Rosa Khutor</p><div id="search"><form action="http://www.rosakhutor.webfactional.com/en/search/" method="get" id="id_search_form"><input type="text" name="search" id="search-input" /><!--input type="submit" value="" /--></form></div><p id="sitemap" class="din-medium"><a href="../../sitemap/index.html">Sitemap</a></p></div><div id="bottom-legal"><ins class="vcard" id="bottom-contacts"><a class="url fn org" href="http://www.rosaski.com/" style="display: none;">The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company</a><p>The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company<br /><span class="adr"><span class="country-name" style="display: none;">Russia</span><span class="street-address">Business-centre "Pavlovo"</span>, <span class="locality">Village Novinki</span>, <span class="region">Istrinskiy Rayon, Moscow reg.</span>, <span class="postal-code">143581</span></span><br />
