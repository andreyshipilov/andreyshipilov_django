Special report: Our correspondent has inspected the Olympic projects within five years before the beginning of the games.</h1><div id="columns"><p>The other day at the meeting of the presidium of the Presidential Board for development of physical culture and sport, high achievement sports, preparation and holding of ХХII Winter Olympics Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressed concern about the pace of Olympic construction at the main Russia’s resort and funding of some facilities by private investors. Our special correspondent has visited Sochi, in order to provide a personal assessment of the scope of the changes on site. </p><p>MARIA SHARAPOVA’S FATHER IS EXTREMELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT POLYANA  </p><p>The first person I met in Sochi was … Yuri Sharapov. Yes, that very person, the father of our tennis player, ex-first racket of the world. Yuri Victorivich was rushing indignantly around the baggage claim zone, spitting out intimidating oaths in perfect English time and again. His anger was justified — he had arrived by business-class, and his baggage could not be found. The contents were invaluable — it was skiing gear. The very fact that Sharapov, as you realize, having the opportunity to ski at any luxury resort in the world, deliberately comes from the United States in order to iron the slopes of Krasnaya Polyana, means a lot. Not only does it mean unique natural landscape, but also a robust service level. When on the next day I got through to him while he was on the slope, he only confirmed my line of though: “Excellent courses, fabulous conditions — you can ski and relax to your heart’s content!”</p><p>However, we had known long before that sports life at the so-called mountain Olympic cluster is in full swing. But we had not heard much about the progress at the construction of the Olympic facilities in the coastal zone. What we saw in Imeretin Valley raised our hopes. Only a year before tour guides from the Organizational Committee Sochi-2014had been shyly avoiding the future construction site. Now they are proudly demonstrating the half-finished cargo sea port at the isthmus of river Mzymta together with the almost completer cargo site.</p><p>What do these projects have to do with Olympics, you may ask? The answer is — everything! They will be used for the delivery of construction materials to the main construction of the decade.  Therefore, how soon the construction of sports arenas proper will begin, will depend on the quality and speed of their completion. But the most amazing thing was that the ride from the airport to Imeretinka took only … ten minutes! I.e., reporters and athletes, who arrive in Sochi, will get to their Olympic accommodation — Olympic Village and Media center, in mere ten minutes.  It appears that the conceptual statement of our Organizational Committee about the unprecedented compactness of the Olympics is not just a meaningless phrase. </p><p>RUSSIAN PISTE, FORTY DEGREES! </p><p>The promised 40-minutes’ ride from Imeretin Valley to the mountain facilities is nothing but a dream so far, though. I am getting to Krasnaya Polyana where all skiing competitions will be taking place using the same road, which I know like the palm of my hand. However, my escorts keep pointing out the road works to me, which will make the way to the mountains shorter. </p><p>Aloft the ski lift of the mountain tourist Gazprom Center Laura inaugurated by Vladimir Putin last January is already operating to capacity. All the courses are fully completed. Some of them are closed solely because of the weather conditions — there is not enough snow in the lower regions. </p><p>However, from the standpoint of skiing disciplines I am really interested in the resort Rosa Khutor, where all 10 sets of skiing awards will be competed for, and where a unique Freestyle Center and Snowboard Park will be integrated in a single finishing zone. If you add to it the mountain Olympic village, which will also be located in Rosa Khutor, you will see the most important Krasnaya Polyana project from the strategic standpoint. </p><p>The ski lift at Rosa is not operating yet — the cable cars are waiting in the wings in a parking which was built specifically for this purpose. Therefore, Director General of ООО Rosa Khutor Sergey Trubin and I are using our locomotives. Just like the Olympic champion of Sapporo-72 from Switzerland Russi when he was designing the local courses. </p><p>“At the beginning of the construction of alpine skiing courses the designer always works on foot,” explains Trubin to the “uninitiated”. “Only afterwards the work on the forest development project begins, felling certificates are obtained. After the future course is cleared from trees, stumps can be extracted and the remaining natural boulders are crushed. Afterwards all these things are removed. In the end the course is grassed, in order to hold the soil together and to keep the show in place. </p><p>The grass has taken root excellently, and the snow remains in place. As for Russi, he has done a good job too — it becomes evident when Trubin shows the finishing zone of the downhill route. </p><p>“This is what we are especially proud of,” declares Sergey Andreevich, beaming. “Here is a forty-degree slope, beyond it there is a sharp turn. Athletes will be flying in the air for about one hundred meters. If they are not prepared sufficiently well, they may break their necks. Our courses will be fast and complicated — real Russian roller-coasters!  The officials from the Coordination Commission of the International Olympic Committee, some of whom are ardent alpine skiers, were exhilarated. </p><p>No wonder! Because downhill is considered to be the most difficult competition in terms of landscape. It requires a long course with a huge drop of heights, over a kilometer. It is not everywhere that you can find such a place in a natural setting, and you cannot create one artificially. “If you have found a good downhill piste, you can organize Olympic Games!” explained to our newspaper Head of Interros Vladimir Potanin on 8 April, 2005 in the very same famous publication which, actually, had been the starting point in the history of Sochi Games-2014. </p><p>FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS ITS POSITIVE SIDES </p><p>Afterwards Trubin, just as proud as before, takes me to the newly built lower base, which is quite ready to accept visitors. Especially impressive are the state-of-the-art device for the treatment of ski edges installed in the middle of the rental zone, and a luxury restaurant styled as a chalet on the second floor. We even peep into service kitchen areas, which include a bakery unit, a unit for initial processing of vegetables and even … a unit for egg processing!</p><p>“Is your construction project expensive?” when you see all this luxury, this question is the first that comes to mind.</p><p>“We began with the budget of $ 140 million. When our project got an Olympic status, and it integrated the Freestyle Center, Snowboard Park, the Mountain Olympic Village, the amount gradually rose to the present level — 1,375 billion bucks. All of it is private investment only.”</p><p>“Is the world financial crisis making things difficult for you?”</p><p>“Yes, because we purchase a lot of imported equipment, which must be paid for in foreign currency. But the crisis has its positive sides: the cost of cement, concrete, reinforcements, inert materials has decreased.</p><p>“Are the previous plans to conduct test competitions still on the agenda?”</p><p>“By all means! In February 2012 we are going to receive the World Cup. Before that, in 2011, we want to house a stage of the European Cup, in order to refine the processes. Next year we are beginning a Championship of Russia of sorts. All this, of course, provided that homologation (certification. — Editor’s note) of the courses by the International Skiing Federation this March goes hitch free.</p><p>“When will the pistes be available to amateur skiers?”</p><p>“As early as in the second half of this year! We will be open as soon as the weather allows. You are welcome!</p><p>…As I leave Sochi, I hear an announcement at the airport about the boarding of the passengers for the flight to Berlin. Does it mean that the full-blast operation of the international terminal is no longer gas? </p><p>MEANWHILE… <br />LAWSUITS ABOUT THE LANDS OF ROSA KHUTOR ARE COMING TO AN END </p><p>Yesterday another, already the second court session on the lease of the lands used for the construction of Rosa Khutor (the Sovetskiy Sport wrote about the scandal which had resulted in suspension of the construction of the Olympic project of December 11, 2008 — Editor’s note), ended with an amicable settlement.</p><p>By way of reminder, last December the Olympic project became the bone of contention in the dispute between two government agencies — Ministry of Natural Resources and Rosimuschestvo, which were unable to reach agreement about who will pay for the use of the territory of the Sochi National Park, leased by OOO Rosa Khutor for 49 years. Yesterdays’ court judgment demonstrates that the differences which threatened to blow the construction deadlines were close to complete settlement. The issue will be deemed to be completely settled if the amicable settlement is reached in respect of the last of the tree leased plots.  The hearings are scheduled for 10 March.</p><p>By Zilbert А.</p></div><table id="sharer"><tr><td id="sharer-text">Share:</td><td id="sharer-buttons"><table><tr><td><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-count="horizontal">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a name="fb_share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></td><td style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"><script type="text/javascript">document.write(VK.Share.button(false,{type: "round", text: "Share"}));</script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a title="Google Buzz" class="google-buzz-button" href="http://www.google.com/buzz/post" data-button-style="small-count"></a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../www.google.com/buzz/api/button.js"></script></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="banners-container"><div id="banners-wrapper"><table id="banners"><tr class="images"><td><a href="../../project/index.html#about"><img src="../../../m/banners/vacancy.png" alt="Jobs" width="290" height="170" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots"><img src="../../../m/banners/resort_banner_1.png" alt="Rental of Сommercial Real Estate" width="290" height="159" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../release-103/index.html"><img src="../../../m/banners/2011-2012.png" alt="Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!" width="290" height="162" /></a></td></tr><tr class="texts"><td><p><a href="../../project/index.html#about">Jobs</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots">Rental of Сommercial Real Estate</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../release-103/index.html">Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!</a></p></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="bottom-container"><div id="bottom"><div id="bottom-addons"><p id="copyright" class="din-medium">&copy; 2005&mdash;2012 LLC Rosa Khutor</p><div id="search"><form action="http://www.rosakhutor.webfactional.com/en/search/" method="get" id="id_search_form"><input type="text" name="search" id="search-input" /><!--input type="submit" value="" /--></form></div><p id="sitemap" class="din-medium"><a href="../../sitemap/index.html">Sitemap</a></p></div><div id="bottom-legal"><ins class="vcard" id="bottom-contacts"><a class="url fn org" href="http://www.rosaski.com/" style="display: none;">The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company</a><p>The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company<br /><span class="adr"><span class="country-name" style="display: none;">Russia</span><span class="street-address">Business-centre "Pavlovo"</span>, <span class="locality">Village Novinki</span>, <span class="region">Istrinskiy Rayon, Moscow reg.</span>, <span class="postal-code">143581</span></span><br />
