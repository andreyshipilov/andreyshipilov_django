This facility is considered to be the main issue of attention of the “white games”, since other sport facilities including ski jumps and bobsleigh tracks are easier to built on hills while downhill skiing requires real mountains with necessary altitude difference for a piste, and Olympic Games are not possible without it.   </p><p>Krasnaya Polyana fully satisfies such requirements.  We expect that very soon, in the next season, the first order of the ski resort “Rosa Khutor” will be opened and first competitions will be held.</p><p>Here in Whistler mountain skiing competitions are very popular, but it takes about two hours of driving to get to the trail from Vancouver. And it is so if one is fortunate.  Yesterday, for example, we spent three hours getting there because of multiple traffic jams. By the way, transport is a weak point of the organizers of these Games. Nobody even think to give the road or clear the special line to the Olympic transport. “May the Olympic Games in Sochi repeat this sad experience?”  — we asked this question to Vice Prime Minister of government of Russia Alexander Zhukov who also  visited the presentation. </p><p>— As it is known, it is 40 kilometers distance between Sochi and Krasnaya Polyana — says Zhukov – It is 40 minutes driving on the new road. Now we are also building a new high-speed railway, which will reduce this time down to 30 minutes. I'll go bail for that everything what is done by government, primarily transport and energy procurement, will be done in due time.</p><p>Then Vladimir Potanin took the floor:</p><p>— Company “Interros” is the largest private investor in Olympic Sochi.  We are going to invest around 2 billion dollars. 1,5 billion will be spent for building of ski resort Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana. We were going to build a world class ski resort several years ago. When Sochi got the right to organize Olympic Games 2014 our center became the main facility of the future Games.    </p><p>— What else “Interros” will build? </p><p>— We are building 6 objects all together: 3 ski stadiums, where mountain skiers, snowboarders and freestylers will compete during the Olympiad 2014. Moreover, we will build a mountain Olympic village (the main Olympic settlement will be built in Sochi — editor). We also plan to build a hotel and Olympic ski school. <br />We are building the ski resort “Rosa Khutor” from the zero cycle. We have not had any experience of building such complexes in Russia. We had to receive lots of approvals, but we were lucky to be supported by Russian government.  This project has been from the very beginning under patronage of Vladimir Putin and I am very thankful for this support. </p><p>— Who was the designer of the complex?</p><p>— First, I would like to thank Bernhard Russi, who helped laying pistes and studied the mountain through the length and breadth. Now we may be sure that our pistes will meet the most recent requirements of FIS.  </p><p>— Will you launch this complex for Olympic Games on time without any defects?</p><p>— In the list of the constructing sport facilities our ski resort takes a leading position as we started its design in 2003. In the next year a Euro Cup will be held in “Rosa Khutor” and in a year the World Cup will take place there. Commit, we are pioneers of Olympic construction.  </p><p>— The Olympic Games will be finished and the complex will remain. But this center may hardly solve problems of ski resorts in Russia. Is there any possibility of its expansion?</p><p>— For “Rosa Khutor” designing we invited world best specialists who developed pistes here in Whistler and in due time in Calgary. They say that in Krasnaya Polyana there are the best of the places which have not been developed yet for mountain skiing. “Rosa Khutor” has on its back side several more valleys perfectly suitable for skiing. If all future facilities are united by a system of ski lifts, then it will be as good as in the well-known Three Valleys. May be that is why I was once moved to say that we will build our own Courchevel in Krasnaya Polyana.</p><p>— We hear that you are going to build another ski resort on Elborus, on the other side of Terskol.  </p><p>— Indeed, we have been working over this project with the president of Kabardino-Balkaria and a favorable investment situation for us was developed, but with a closeup it appeared that the back side of Elborus is not suitable for ski competition. There are unfavorable wind rose, ice-covered hillsides there. Thus, this project will not be realized. I think we need to move to the place where there is a possibility for it. As we have invested a lot of money in Sochi it is worth to continue the work. With regard to Elborus we think it is better to focus on improvement and modernization activities in Treskol, as the new is not always better than the old and forgotten. </p><p>— You have great plans…. And at the same time you have recently declared that you sacrifice all the money for the benefit of the state.</p><p>No, not for the benefit of the state, but for charity and social programs in which the  state is not involved at all. Capital should work here if it is earned in Russia and bring some social meaning. As for my children, so, please do not worry — they live in plenty.</p><p>by Kirill Serov</p></div><table id="sharer"><tr><td id="sharer-text">Share:</td><td id="sharer-buttons"><table><tr><td><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-count="horizontal">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a name="fb_share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></td><td style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"><script type="text/javascript">document.write(VK.Share.button(false,{type: "round", text: "Share"}));</script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a title="Google Buzz" class="google-buzz-button" href="http://www.google.com/buzz/post" data-button-style="small-count"></a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../www.google.com/buzz/api/button.js"></script></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="banners-container"><div id="banners-wrapper"><table id="banners"><tr class="images"><td><a href="../../project/index.html#about"><img src="../../../m/banners/vacancy.png" alt="Jobs" width="290" height="170" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots"><img src="../../../m/banners/resort_banner_1.png" alt="Rental of Сommercial Real Estate" width="290" height="159" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../release-103/index.html"><img src="../../../m/banners/2011-2012.png" alt="Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!" width="290" height="162" /></a></td></tr><tr class="texts"><td><p><a href="../../project/index.html#about">Jobs</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots">Rental of Сommercial Real Estate</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../release-103/index.html">Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!</a></p></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="bottom-container"><div id="bottom"><div id="bottom-addons"><p id="copyright" class="din-medium">&copy; 2005&mdash;2012 LLC Rosa Khutor</p><div id="search"><form action="http://www.rosakhutor.webfactional.com/en/search/" method="get" id="id_search_form"><input type="text" name="search" id="search-input" /><!--input type="submit" value="" /--></form></div><p id="sitemap" class="din-medium"><a href="../../sitemap/index.html">Sitemap</a></p></div><div id="bottom-legal"><ins class="vcard" id="bottom-contacts"><a class="url fn org" href="http://www.rosaski.com/" style="display: none;">The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company</a><p>The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company<br /><span class="adr"><span class="country-name" style="display: none;">Russia</span><span class="street-address">Business-centre "Pavlovo"</span>, <span class="locality">Village Novinki</span>, <span class="region">Istrinskiy Rayon, Moscow reg.</span>, <span class="postal-code">143581</span></span><br />
