Meanwhile, the construction works on most of the Olympic projects have not even started. </p><p>On Thursday, at the press conference in Sochi with participation of Vice Prime Ministers of the Russian Federation Alexander Zhukov and Dmitry Kozak and the President of the Organizational Committee Sochi-2014 Dmitry Chernyshenko the Head of the Coordination Commission of IOC Jean-Claude Killy provided his evaluation of the tempo of preparation of Sochi for the Olympic Games. According to him, IOC is confident that the project will be implemented in a timely manner.  "The Sochi Olympics may become a source of inspiration not only for Russia, but for the entire world,” he said. </p><p>FROM PROJECTS TO IMPLEMENTATION</p><p>Jean-Claude Killy was happy with the progress achieved by the organizational committee Sochi-2014" and promised to come back to Sochi within six weeks with a formal visit: "I am sure that preparation for the competitions will be carried out according to the highest standards. In the course of this visit we have received another evidence of support for this project. This work is a catalyser for regional development. Vice President of the RF Government Dmitry Kozak told us that in the course of construction of the sports facilities the “green” standards system is being used, which is an important step in terms of environment protection. Our commission has not detected any faults in the preparation of Sochi for the Olympics. At the same time, the organizers of the Games should keep up the momentum. We are amazed by Russia’s commitment to this cause.” </p><p>Dmitry Kozak assured all those present that the construction of all Olympic projects and infrastructure of the city of Sochi is going on in full conformance with the schedule. "This allows us to feel positive about meeting the deadlines for the construction of the sports competition facilities and the infrastructure required for them and for the development of the Black Sea region. The main projects will be completed in 2012. We have commenced actual physical construction of four palaces in Imeretin Valley," he emphasized. In his turn, Dmitry Chernyshenko noted that Russia had made another step to towards the Olympics. "Today we have passed an exam and mover to another grade. We have moved from the strategic (basic plan of the Games which we had formally delivered to IOC) to operational planning", he said. </p><p>Meanwhile, at most of the Olympic facilities the construction works have not even started, and some of them are still being designed. The city roads, which are supposed to have been improved by the time the Games commence, still leave much to be desired. One of the rare positive exceptions is the skiing resort in the neighborhood of Krasnaya Polyana "Rosa Khutor", where the construction is in full swing. Here the medal events in skiing disciplines, freestyle and snowboard will be held in 2014. According to Director General of “Rosa Khutor" Sergey Trubin, already by the end of 2010 the facility will be ready for the international competitions. As test tournaments before the Olympics, in 2011it will host a Skiing European Cup, and in 2012 the World Cup.</p><p>THE PRICE OF THE OLYMPICS</p><p>The journalists who attended the press conference, were also interested in the total cost of the Olympic Games (the cost of all sports facilities and infrastructure), which is pretty difficult to calculate due to uncertain situation in the construction materials market. According to Dmitry Kozak, subject to approximate estimates, this amount will make up 206 billion roubles, of which only 118 billion roubles will be accounted for by the taxpayers’ money. The rest will be provided by private companies. "Today all the investors have conformed their commitments. Moreover, in the nearest future we will acquire two more investors, who will undertake the construction and maintenance of the Small Ice Arena and skating center.  Therefore, the amount of 118 billion roubles of which we are talking today will decrease significantly. Thus, most of the money spent on the Olympics will be obtained from non-budgetary sources."</p><p>Vice Prime Minister of the RF Government  Alexander Zhukov specified that the budget of the Organizational Committee Sochi-2014 for the organization and holding the Games makes up $1.8 billion, of which only $330 million will be spent by the state, and the rest will be provided by investors and IOC. </p><p>OLYMPICS AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE DEMAND AND “RELOCATION” ISSUES</p><p>Olympic Games is a powerful instrument of support for the demand and one of the important components of RF’s anti-crisis program, believes Dmitry Kozak. "Only today Olympic construction sites employ 8.5 thousand construction workers. Olympics mean demand for metal, while today metallurgical industry is going through hard times, they mean demand for construction materials, transportation services," he said.</p><p>One of the most difficult subjects is the relocation of the people who live in Imeretin Valley, where sports facilities and the Olympic village will be erected. The main concern is that the people will not be getting adequate compensation for their houses, or that they will be relocated to the housing with lower standards. However, Kozak does not believe that any serious difficulties may arise here: "Presently there is a network schedule for the relocation of the population and construction of housing for these people, which is synchronized with the dates of the beginning and completion of the erection of the Olympic projects. In Imeretin Valley the physical resettlement will begin at the end of this year, for this purpose the construction of the housing has already begun in the village of Nekrasovskoye — most people will relocate there. About 25 families turned down the offers of new housing and received compensation in cash."</p><p>By Kozin А.</p></div><table id="sharer"><tr><td id="sharer-text">Share:</td><td id="sharer-buttons"><table><tr><td><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-count="horizontal">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a name="fb_share" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a><script src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" type="text/javascript"></script></td><td style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"><script type="text/javascript">document.write(VK.Share.button(false,{type: "round", text: "Share"}));</script></td><td style="padding: 1px 20px 0px 0px;"><a title="Google Buzz" class="google-buzz-button" href="http://www.google.com/buzz/post" data-button-style="small-count"></a><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../../www.google.com/buzz/api/button.js"></script></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="banners-container"><div id="banners-wrapper"><table id="banners"><tr class="images"><td><a href="../release-103/index.html"><img src="../../../m/banners/2011-2012.png" alt="Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!" width="290" height="162" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../../project/index.html#about"><img src="../../../m/banners/vacancy.png" alt="Jobs" width="290" height="170" /></a></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots"><img src="../../../m/banners/resort_banner_1.png" alt="Rental of Сommercial Real Estate" width="290" height="159" /></a></td></tr><tr class="texts"><td><p><a href="../release-103/index.html">Оpening of a new season in Rosa Khutor!</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../../project/index.html#about">Jobs</a></p></td><td class="spacer"></td><td><p><a href="../../realty/index.html#salespots">Rental of Сommercial Real Estate</a></p></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="bottom-container"><div id="bottom"><div id="bottom-addons"><p id="copyright" class="din-medium">&copy; 2005&mdash;2012 LLC Rosa Khutor</p><div id="search"><form action="http://www.rosakhutor.webfactional.com/en/search/" method="get" id="id_search_form"><input type="text" name="search" id="search-input" /><!--input type="submit" value="" /--></form></div><p id="sitemap" class="din-medium"><a href="../../sitemap/index.html">Sitemap</a></p></div><div id="bottom-legal"><ins class="vcard" id="bottom-contacts"><a class="url fn org" href="http://www.rosaski.com/" style="display: none;">The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company</a><p>The Rosa Khutor Ski Resort Development Company<br /><span class="adr"><span class="country-name" style="display: none;">Russia</span><span class="street-address">Business-centre "Pavlovo"</span>, <span class="locality">Village Novinki</span>, <span class="region">Istrinskiy Rayon, Moscow reg.</span>, <span class="postal-code">143581</span></span><br />
